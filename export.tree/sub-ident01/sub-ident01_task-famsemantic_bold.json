    "Instructions": "In this task, we will ask you to imagine novel events involving familiar people and places, and common objects. For familiar people, you’ll imagine them talking about common conversation topics. For familiar places, you’ll imagine navigating or moving through a specific area. For objects, you’ll imagine them engaging in physical interactions. For all conditions, you should imagine a new event, not recall a memory of a past event. Please imagine the event continuously throughout each 18s-long block, which will start with a text prompt, followed by a thought bubble icon. At the end of each block, the thought bubble will switch to a + sign, and you can stop imagining. For physical interactions, if the event ends before the block is over, you can imagine it repeating.",
    "TaskDescription": "Prior to this task, participants were asked to choose six of the ten people and places that they're most familiar with.
