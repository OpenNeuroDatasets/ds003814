    "Instructions": "In this task, you'll see images of familiar and unfamiliar people and places, and objects. Each image will last two seconds. Whenever you see two images in a row that are exactly the same, press a button with your right pointer finger.",
    "TaskDescription": "Prior to this task, participants were asked to choose six of the ten people and places that they're most familiar with. The experimenter then obtained 20 naturalistic images of each person's face and each scene, along with unfamiliar face and scene control images, and images of generic objects (e.g. a banana, a baseball). Familiar and unfamiliar faces were controlled for age, race, and gender; familiar and unfamiliar scenes were controlled for rough semantic category (e.g., outdoor street view). Face and object images contained neither clear spatial structure (e.g., corners) nor contextual cues. Scene images contained no people. All categories were matched, within each participant separately, on the mean and cross-image-variance of luminance, root-mean-square contrast, and saturation. Images were presented on a gray background at 768 x 768 resolution, 12.8 x 12.8 degrees of visual angle, for 1.85s each with a 150ms interstimulus interval, in 18s blocks of images of one identity. Participants performed a one-back task, pressing a button when an image was repeated."
