    "TaskFullName": "Familiarity Task 3: Episodic Simulation",
    "Instructions": "In this task, we will ask you to imagine novel events involving familiar people and places, and common objects. For familiar people, you’ll imagine them talking about common conversation topics. For familiar places, you’ll imagine navigating or moving through a specific area. For objects, you’ll imagine them engaging in physical interactions. For all conditions, you should imagine a new event, not recall a memory of a past event. Please imagine the event continuously throughout each 18 second-long block, which will start with a text prompt, followed by a thought bubble icon. At the end of each block, you will see a button press icon, at which point you should press the button with your right pointer finger, and stop imagining the event. This will be followed by a + sign, between blocks. For physical interactions, if the event ends before the block is over, you can imagine it repeating.",
    "TaskDescription": "Prior to this task, participants were asked to choose six of the ten people and places that they're most familiar with. For each familiar person, they were asked to provide five common conversation topics, and for each familiar place, five subregions that they're familiar with. During the task, participants imagine novel events involving familiar people and places, and generic objects. Specifically, they imagine familiar people talking about common conversation topics, navigating through subregions of familiar places, and generic objects engaged in physical interactions. Each event is imagined over the course of an 18s-long block, consisting of a 3s-long text prompt, an image of a thought bubble presented for 14s, and lastly a hand icon, which instructs participants to press a button and stop imagining the event."
